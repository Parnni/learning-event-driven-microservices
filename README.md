# 🏨 Event-Driven Microservices with Python & AWS

## 📖 About This Project
This repository documents my learning journey into **event-driven microservice architecture** and **cloud-native distributed systems** using **Python** and **AWS**.  

I’m following a Udemy course that walks through building a complete **Hotel Booking System**, where multiple microservices communicate asynchronously using events. The goal is to gain practical, hands-on experience in designing, coding, and deploying resilient and scalable systems.

## 🚀 What I’m Learning
- **Architecture of modern event-driven and cloud-native systems**
- **AWS services for microservices**, including:
  - Cognito  
  - API Gateway  
  - Lambda  
  - ECS  
  - DynamoDB  
  - S3  
  - SNS  
  - CloudMap  
  - Secrets Manager  
- **Python microservices** using FastAPI (or Flask)
- **Serverless Python microservices**
- **Architectural patterns** like:
  - API Gateway pattern  
  - Event Bus  
  - Circuit Breaker  
  - CQRS  
- **Containerized microservices** using Docker and ECS

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
**Language:** Python  
**Frameworks:** FastAPI / Flask  
**Cloud Platform:** AWS  
**AWS Services:** Lambda, DynamoDB, SNS, SQS, S3, API Gateway, CloudMap, Secrets Manager, ECS, EventBridge  
**Other Tools:** Docker, Git, Postman

## 🧱 Project Overview
The system being built is a **Hotel Booking Platform** where multiple services (such as Hotel, Booking, Payment, and Notification) interact via **events** instead of direct communication.  
Each microservice is independently deployable and scalable, with data managed through separate storage and communication handled through AWS event services.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Understand how to architect event-driven systems.
- Learn to build **independent and resilient microservices**.
- Practice **Python + AWS integration** for serverless and containerized deployments.
- Gain confidence deploying microservices using **AWS native services**.
